# Personal Website
This is my personal website developed by myself all from scratch. 

#Description
This website is a project that I use to practice my front-end programming skills. As I learn, I am constantly trying to apply my new knowledge to this website. Currently this site is only done in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is deployed on AWS.
